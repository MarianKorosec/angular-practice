# angular-practice
This repository includes the fundamentals from the Angular Page (https://angular.io/) in order to facilitate basic TypeScript and Angular programming skills. This Project is targeted to personal practice.

# Initial Project
This branch is the initial Version of this Github Repository, however, the Project already includes all Angular Fundamentals until and including Dependency Injection.
This is due to the projecting being a local project so far.  
This branch represents the state of the project directly after exporting the local Project to a Github project.

# Dependency Injection Fundamental
The Dependency Injection Branch represents the project state after including all Angular Fundamentals until the Dependency Injection Fundamental.  
This is the final version of the project (thus far), it shouldn't change anymore from this point on but one never knows.

# Routing and Navigation Fundamental
This Branch adds a new Project to the Repository. The Routing and Navigation Angular Fundamental is pretty extensive and therefore a new Angular project was my most favorable choice.  
New Project for Routing and Navigation Fundamental: [Routing and Navigation Branch] 

# Bootstrap
The Bootstrap Branch includes some Bootstrap practice from W3Schools and also some personal experimenting to facilitate basic knowledge about using Bootstrap to design a Website.  
However, the main part of this branch consists of the template for the EV-Wallbox Webapplication created with Bootstrap.
