# angular-practice
This repository includes the fundamentals from the Angular Page (https://angular.io/) in order to facilitate basic TypeScript and Angular programming skills. This Project is targeted to personal practice.

# Initial Project
This branch is the initial Version of this Github Repository, however, the Project already includes all Angular Fundamentals until and including Dependency Injection.
This is due to the projecting being a local project so far.  
This branch represents the state of the project directly after exporting the local Project to a Github project.  
Initial Project Branch: [InitialProjectBranch]
